FINDING LOCATIONS EASILY

Traditional addresses don't work. That's the argument of London startup what3words,
which says we often (0) ______ difficulty giving and finding addresses.
The company's answer was to divide the world (17) ______ 57 trillion squares and give
them each a unique combination of three words, that is, a 3-word address.
The idea came from what3words director Chris Sheldrick, (18) ______ former live
music organizer. He often got annoyed when he needed to drop off equipment somewhere or
tell a band where (19) ______ go. Addresses either didn't exist, they weren't accurate enough,
(20) ______ they were difficult to communicate.
Sheldrick started using GPS coordinates, but they were difficult to remember or share.
Then, (21) ______ day, he and a friend found a solution. There was a dictionary on the table,
and they wondered how many different words (22) ______ would take to build a system using
words. The answer is about 40,000, put together in groups of three.
It works (23) ______ this: Say you want to meet a friend at the mall, but there are lots
of entrances and no easy way to explain (24) ______ you are. By using the what3words mapping
app, you can mark out the specific entrance, tap on a virtual square and you will get a phrase
fixed to that location, like "caramel.kingdom.signature" â€” a real phrase tied to a location in
Hong Kong. The app then lets you open up the address in another mapping provider,
(25) ______ as Google Maps, which can direct you there.
